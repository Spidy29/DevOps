# ðŸš€ DevOps Learning Journey: Getting Started

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! I'm just starting my journey to learn DevOps from scratch. This repo will document my progress as I learn the fundamentals and build my skills step by step.

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus: Fundamentals

I'm currently focusing on building a strong foundation in DevOps basics:

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Core Fundamentals (Starting Now!)

- [ ] Understanding DevOps Culture & Principles
- [ ] Version Control with Git
- [ ] Linux/Unix Command Line
- [ ] Networking Basics
- [ ] Basic Scripting (Bash/PowerShell)

### ï¿½ Next Steps (Future Phases)

Once I master the fundamentals, I'll move on to:

- Containerization (Docker)
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Cloud Platforms
- Infrastructure as Code
- And much more...
